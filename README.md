# url-shortener
A solution to create a url shortner service


# Architecture

## Front/UI

> I decided to go with NextJS: a framework i use a lot and that can be easily deployed with Vercel

## Back/API

> A simple way to answer the issue: easy to confure, initiate and deploy.

## DB

> Classic SQL DB will do the job (but scalability can become an issue...)
