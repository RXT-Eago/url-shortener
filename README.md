# url-shortener
A solution to create a url shortner service

### Frontend
> In order to create a urlShortener i decide to go with NextJs for the front
wich is a framework is used a lot and I'm familiar with.
This was the occasion to discover their new [App Router](!https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

### Backend
> As proposed in the exercice i decided to go with express knowing the code needed would only require ~50 lines (using Nest for this case is IMO over engineered)

### ORM
> In order to abstract class from my back into my DB i decided to go with **Prisma**: a well known ORM ( i already used it but a lot more exist and are as interresting and valuable (TypeORM etc...))

### DB
> As requested i used Postgres for the DB wich is a high value choice and a tool i really appreciate working with.
